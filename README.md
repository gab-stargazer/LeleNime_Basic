# LeleNime 

Lelenime is a mobile application developed with the aim of providing access to anime indexes on MAL without having to open a browser and with a better experience. This application was built using the Kotlin programming language and can only be used on the Android-only platform.

## Note
At the moment, this project is on reconstruction phase, so everything in here is not ready for production yet. I'am trying my best to improve the code before releasing it again as stable release.
